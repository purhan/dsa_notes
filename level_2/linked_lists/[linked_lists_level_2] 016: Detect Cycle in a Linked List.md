# Problem Statement

[Tutorial]()

# Thought Process
- Striver had a better video on this
- Two approaches:

- Create a hashmap and store the addresses. If an address repeats, you have a cycle at that point

- Create a slow and a fast pointer. If they meet, it's a cycle. If fast reaches NULL, you dont have a cycle.
